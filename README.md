# 🪄 MEGA_links

A fast, stupidly simple PowerShell prank project.  
Download → run a `.bat` → chaos (or not).

No dependencies.  
No patience required.  
No regrets (maybe).

## 🚀 What is MEGA_links?

**MEGA_links** is a tiny PowerShell prank system driven entirely by **batch files**.

You don’t need to understand PowerShell.  
You don’t need admin rights.  
You don’t need a plan.

👉 Just download the project and **double‑click a `.bat` file**.

Execution takes **seconds**.  
Psychological damage may last longer.

## ⚙️ How it works (simple version)

- The **`.bat` files** are the entry point  
- Each `.bat` launches `MEGA_links.ps1` with a specific **mode**
- The PowerShell script does the dirty work:
  - displays an image
  - blocks (or politely doesn’t block) the user
  - cleans everything after itself
  - installs persistence (only if you really asked for it)

No services.  
No registry madness.  
Just vibes.

## 🎭 Available modes

### 😈 without_empathy
- Opens a **PNG image in fullscreen**
- Temporarily **blocks user interaction**
- Forces the user to *emotionally accept the situation*
- Once the window is closed:

> Short. Brutal. Memorable.
